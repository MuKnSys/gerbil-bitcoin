How to get bitcoind running on the command line
===============================================

As root, run
$ find / -name "bitcoind"

Then go to the directory it's in, and run

$ ./bitcoind

That starts up the daemon, which you  can then query using bitcoin-cli.

Next, find bitcoin-cli

Then you can run e.g.

$ bitcoin-cli getbestblockhash

and then

bitcoin-cli getblock <string returned by bitcoin-cli getbestblockhash>

To stop bitcoind running, execute

$ bitcoin-cli stop

Connecting remotely will require an http server to be running on mallory.
